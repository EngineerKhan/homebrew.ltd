# Welcome

Welcome to the team! We’re really excited to bring you onboard. 

## Expectations

|Expectation| What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Take Initiative | Take ownership of an area. If you see a problem, take it and own it to completion. Your work will often not be defined, or poorly defined. Take the initiative to figure out what needs to be done, seek others out for clarifications, and then communicate what you will be doing to the team. |
| Bias to Action | There are many problem-filled areas. There is no need to ask for permission or try to build consensus: just take action. After 2-3 months, you should be able to show clear results having turned around a problem-filled area. |
| Communication | We require clear, effective and timely communication, which enables others to coordinate with you to be effective. We are a fully distributed, remote team of people from different cultures and languages. If conflicts do arise, first assume Hanlon’s Razor: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity lack of communication or too much ambiguity”. Don’t take things personally, be a professional. |
| Mastery | We are working in a frontier industry, where there are no playbooks, and expertise is developed by doing. Own your area, and build mastery.  |

## Code of conduct

- Be available and communicative during scheduled meetings or work hours.
- Employees should seek a quiet and distraction-free working space, to the extent possible.
- Turning on video during meetings is encouraged.
- Casual dress during meetings is acceptable; however, use discretion (No pajamas, etc.)
- We encourage constructive debate, but don’t make it personal.
- Respect other people's cultures. Especially since we are working in a diverse working culture.
- Side-gigs: we have a similar policy as [Posthog](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/side-gigs). We encourage you to take advisory/board positions, and volunteer, but do so in a responsible way. Clear up external engagements with HR first to avoid legal or IP dispute issues.
- Sexual harassment is prohibited: Conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offense or humiliation. Sexual harassment may involve any conduct of a verbal, nonverbal, or physical nature, including written and electronic communications, and may occur between persons of the same or different genders.
