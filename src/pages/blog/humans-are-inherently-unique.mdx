# Humans are inherently unique

<BlogAuthors authors={["Emre Can Kartal"]}/>

Humans are inherently unique.

We are becoming uniform. A trend emerges on social media platforms, and we follow it. When something is used by celebrities we follow, it becomes more valuable to us.

Our clothes, the games we play, the places we go, even our character at some point cease to be our own. We change. 

We become other people. All together.

We now do things that others deem appropriate for us, rather than what we used to love or feel closer to.

Our identity is filled with values rented out from others.

In fact, we are renting out.

Our views, our likes, our loves, and even our character that changes with them. 

We adopt things that are monopolized by others as if they were our own.

The only thing we can access them through are those small devices we rent out. Because there will never be an iPhone higher than the latest version of the iPhone, and this is where we become equal. 

This is the new type of being uniform.

### The illusion of ownership

Just as we become uniform, especially in tech, it's not so possible to own something.

Even when we buy, we can't own the products. Every moment you connect to the internet is tracked so that better products can emerge.

Our likes are used to make us more addicted, our messages to sell us more products.

These technologies, created entirely to understand the individual, don't offer us complete ownership and also make us all uniform.

We no longer have, we live in the illusion that we own the things we rent out.

At Homebrew, our core value is to build things that we can truly own and that will be completely unique to us.

Only in this way can we do things that have never been done before. 

We can ask questions that have never been asked. 

We can produce new answers to questions that have been asked before.

That's why we're interested in self-hosted technologies. This is why we contribute to open-source projects that we can all tinker with.

This is precisely why we make all our products open-source and user-owned.

Being unique and maintaining ownership is more valuable than we think.

Don't rent your personality from someone else, own it.

We invite you to embrace technologies that you can completely own and fully customize.
