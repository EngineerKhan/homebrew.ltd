# Principles

Homebrew operates on [open-source principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#:~:text=The%20open%20source%20model%20is,freely%20available%20to%20the%20public.), giving everyone the freedom to adjust, personalize, and contribute to its development. 

Our focus is on creating a community-powered ecosystem that prioritizes transparency, customization, and user privacy. As a result, most of our new team members come from our community.

For more on our principles, visit our [About page](https://homebrew.ltd/about).

## Open-Source

We embrace open development, showcasing our progress and upcoming features on GitHub, and we encourage your input and contributions:

- ðŸ‘‹ [Jan](https://github.com/janhq/jan): Privacy-conscious Personal AI
- ðŸ¤– [Cortex](https://github.com/janhq/cortex): Local AI Engine
- ðŸ¦„ [llama3-s](https://github.com/homebrewltd/llama3-s): Llama3 that can hear and speak

## Build in Public

Wise is the one who can learn from other's mistakes. We share our learnings publicly, using [Discord](https://discord.gg/uakhH2S7sZ) to build in public and welcome anyone to join in.

## Collaboration 

Our team spans the globe, working remotely to bring Homebrew projects to life. We coordinate through Discord and GitHub, valuing async communication and minimal, purposeful meetings. 

For collaboration and brainstorming, we utilize tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/), ensuring alignment and shared vision through visual storytelling and detailed documentation on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).
