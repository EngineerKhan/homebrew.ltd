# Vision

> "I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them" - Isaac Asimov

At Homebrew, we're architecting the cybernetic future of humanity. We aim to create AI that propels our species forward and expands the horizons of human potential.

History shows that new technologies bring both excitement and fear:

- Electricity sparked fear before it powered our world
- Space travel was impossible until we touched the stars
- AI stands as our next leap forward and offers both promise and challenges

In this leap, we are the craftsmen forging the tools that will shape our species' destiny. We're creating a cybernetic future where AI and humanity evolve together, each enhancing the other's capabilities.

## Collaborating with Thinking Machines

Imagine a world where anyone can tinker with AI as easily as Luke Skywalker could with R2-D2, without the need for support tickets to some far-off server. This is the future we're building - where AI is not a black box, but an instrument of progress designed to be understood, modified, and improved by those who use it.

We build AI to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. Our vision is to create AIs that work alongside humans, enabling us to do more, live better lives, and help build a stronger society. Our aim is to build AI that empowers the next generation to achieve feats we couldnâ€™t even imagine today.

> We like that Luke can just open up R2-D2 and tinker around. He was not submitting support tickets to a centralized server somewhere in the galaxy.

## Solarpunk, not Dune

Our vision is rooted in an optimistic view of AI's role in humanity's future.

Like the [Solarpunk movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), we envision a world where technology and nature coexist harmoniously. 

At Homebrew, our commitment is to develop AI that is energy-efficient and earth-friendly. Because the future we're building is about harmony that respects our planet and all its inhabitants.
