# Vision

At Homebrew, our mission is to push the human race forward.

We see a future where humanity can focus on what truly matters - after drinking our homebrew coffees. ☕

**Our vision is simple**: AI that helps us solve global challenges, make groundbreaking discoveries, and build a stronger civilization. AI makes us better – as thinkers, as tinkerers, as human beings.

History shows that new technologies bring both excitement and fear:

- Electricity sparked fear before it powered our world
- Space travel was impossible until we touched the stars
- AI stands as our next leap forward and offers both promise and challenges

In this leap, we are the tool makers forging the tools that will create the things we couldn't imagine today, and help our children solve tomorrow's problems.

## Human Augmentation

We're building AI that works alongside humans by enhancing our abilities, expanding our potential, and enabling us to overcome challenges we couldn't yet imagine today.

This is the future we're building at Homebrew:

- AI that helps us see connections we might miss
- AI that collaborates with us to push the boundaries of innovation
- AI that allows us to focus on what matters

> We like that Luke can just open up R2-D2 and tinker around. He was not submitting support tickets to a centralized server somewhere in the galaxy.

## Earth Friendly

Our vision is rooted in an optimistic view of AI's role in humanity's future. 

One of humanity's most astonishing capabilities is our ability to perform incredibly complex and creative tasks without the need for massive power sources. The human brain is capable of doing extraordinary feats of cognition while consuming minimal energy.

Current AIs require enormous amounts of energy and generate significant heat. This is also a call to action for a problem that we need to solve to do more. That's why we are working on AI that runs earth-friendly on energy efficient hardware.

This approach preserves our world for future generations. It's setting the stage for a civilization that can expand beyond Earth.
