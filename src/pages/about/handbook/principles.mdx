# Principles

At Homebrew, we follow a few core principles to guide us in building our products.

### User Owned

We build tools that are user-owned. Our products are [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), designed to run offline or be [self-hosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/). We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg) [^1].

We adopt [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) principles and store data locally in [universal file formats](https://stephango.com/file-over-app). We build for privacy by default, and we do not [collect or sell your data](/privacy). 

### Right to Tinker

We believe in the [Right to Repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair). We encourage our users to take it further by [tinkering, extending, and customizing](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a4395/pm-remembers-steve-jobs-how-his-philosophy-changed-technology-6507117/) our products to fit their needs. 

Our products are designed with [Extension APIs](/docs/extensions), and we do our best to write good [documentation](/docs) so users understand how things work under the hood. 

### Build with the Community

We are part of a larger open-source community and are committed to being a good jigsaw puzzle piece. We credit and actively contribute to upstream projects.
