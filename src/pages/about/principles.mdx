# Principles

### Build in Public

- **[Build-in Public](https://smallschool.is/build-in-public/what#:~:text=It%20means%20building%20a%20company,were%20making%20as%20trade%20secrets.)**: We document our journey, successes, and failures
- Invite the community to join us

### Open Science

_The Open Science movement at CERN, the birthplace of the World Wide Web._

We believe in [open science](https://www.cos.io/open-science). Our research findings, methodologies, and many of our tools are publicly available for scrutiny and further development by the wider AI community.

- **[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)**: We share our code, and everyone can build upon and improve our work
- Collaboration, not competition
- On long enough time scales, competitors are actually our collaborators


### Right to Tinker

- **Right to Tinker**: We encourage our users to take it further by tinkering, extending, and customizing our products to fit their needs 

- **User Ownership of Data**: Your data remains yours, always
- **Local-first**: We adopt [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) principles and store data locally in [universal file formats.](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
- **Self-hosted**: We provide options for users to run our AI on their own infrastructure

We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg)

### Privacy

AI can be very dangerous from the perspective that [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) accumulates way too much power, and privacy is sacrificed for utility. We believe AI can be advanced without sacrificing privacy.

- Our tools are private by default
- All analytics is opt-in
- We provide clear notices if we are collecting data
