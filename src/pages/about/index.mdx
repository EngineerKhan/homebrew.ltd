# Homebrew 

## About 

Homebrew is an AI research lab. Our mission is to build human-augmenting AIs that run on energy-efficient and earth-friendly hardware.

Our products:

- üëã [Jan](https://jan.ai): A personal AI that learns and evolves with user interactions
- ü§ñ [Cortex](/cortex): A modular AI engine that allows developers to run and build AI on any hardware

<Callout>
We were inspired by the [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) was an early computer hobbyist group from 1975 to 1986 that led to Apple and the personal computer revolution.

We are working towards a 2035 vision where AI and humanity evolve symbiotically, enhancing human capabilities while preserving our home, Earth. Keep reading how we see the future at [Vision page.](https://homebrew.ltd/about/handbook/vision)

Homebrew is an opinionated company with a clear philosophy for the products we build:

### Open Science

We believe in open science. Our research findings, methodologies, and many of our tools are publicly available for scrutiny and further development by the wider AI community.

- `Open Source`: We share our code, and everyone can build upon and improve our work.
- `Build in Public`: We document our journey, successes, and failures
- `Right to Tinker`: We encourage our users to take it further by¬†tinkering[^1], extending, and customizing¬†our products to fit their needs.

### Privacy-conscious

AI can be very dangerous from the perspective that [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) accumulates way too much power, and privacy is sacrificed for utility. We believe AI can be advanced without sacrificing privacy.

- `User Ownership of Data`: Your data remains yours, always.
- `Local-first`: We adopt¬†[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)¬†principles and store data locally in¬†[universal file formats.](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
- `Self-hosted`: We provide options for users to run our AI on their own infrastructure.

We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg) [^2].

### Environmental Responsibility

Earth has been our home for billions of years. We owe future generations a habitable planet. We solve difficult problems at the hardware, software, and infrastructure levels to ensure that our work in AI does not harm the environment. We go beyond zero-carbon AI, to innovate on technologies like immersion cooling and energy-efficient chips, to make this happen.

- `Beyond Zero Carbon`: We aim for net-positive environmental impact in our AI.
- `Energy Innovation`: We pioneer technologies like [immersion cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_cooling) and energy-efficient chips to reduce AI's energy footprint.
- `Resource Optimization`: We focus on maximizing AI performance per watt.

We welcome business inquiries: üëã hello@homebrew.ltd
</Callout>

We're currently a bootstrapped startup [^3]. We balance technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model (e.g., consulting, paid support, and custom development).

### Community

We have a thriving community, where we also discuss our other projects: 

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/AAGQNpJQtH)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janframework)
- [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/company/janframework/)
