# About

‚òï Coffee? Yes, but we brew AI too.

Homebrew is an AI research lab. Our mission is to build human-augmenting AIs that run on energy-efficient hardware.

<Callout>
We were inspired by the [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club), an early computer hobbyist group from 1975 to 1986 that led to Apple and the personal computer revolution.

## What drives us

History shows that new technologies bring both excitement and fear:

- Electricity sparked fear before it powered our world
- Space travel was impossible until we touched the stars
- AI stands as our next leap forward and offers both promise and challenges

Like fire that cooked our food and forged our tools, or electricity that powered our cities and connected our world, AI sparks both wonder and worry. We believe that [AI augmenting human creativity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-024-09677-x) will help us change the future we've yet to imagine.

### Human Augmentation

_We like that [Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker) can just open up [R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2) and tinker around._

[Tools made us human](https://news.emory.edu/features/2019/03/tiny-tools/index.html). Human cognitive abilities, along with tool augmentation from stone to modern technology have enabled us to continue our lineage. 

As toolbuilders, we've created a variety of tools for different purposes. This capability to create specialized tools allowed us to transmit knowledge and skills across generations.

Now we have something called artificial intelligence that is more capable than the things we had before. We see the future AI enhances our abilities, allows us to tinker and explore, collaborates with us, and lets us focus on what truly matters.

We're currently a bootstrapped startup [^3]. We balance technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model (e.g., consulting, paid support, and custom development).
