Homebrew is an AI R&D lab. We are focused on training practical, useful AIs that run on low power hardware. 


We're currently a self-funded startup, balancing technical invention with the search for a sustainable business model (e.g., consulting, paid support, and custom development)[^3].

We welcome business inquiries: üëã hello@homebrew.ltd

We are inspired by the [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club), an early computer hobbyist group from 1975 to 1986 that led to Apple and the personal computer revolution.

## Vision 

### Human Augmentation

![Spectacles](./_assets/history_eyewear.jpg)
_Spectacles improved human vision._

**Image**
- Exoskeleton-based AI (e.g. Jarvis, Halo, ) vs. Figure Robot
- Human Augmentation vs. Human Replacement

**Key Points**
- Our research is focused on human augmentation, not replacement
  - AGI and robotic vision as pushed by the major AI labs is centered on Human Replacement
    - The message is: this AI/robot is faster, better than you
    - Automation
  - Our vision for AI is focused on Human Augmentation
    - Spectacles, hearing aids, Phones
    - Simple, practical tools that enable us to do more
    - Collaborative symbiotic relationships that allow us to tinker and explore
- Humans are natural toolbuilders
  - To our ancestors, our current powers (e.g. electricity) would appear god-like
  - Our current lives are the culmination of millenia of toolmaking, from the wheel, to electricity, to iPhones
  - AI is the latest tool, and we are only in the early innings (e.g. transformers)
- Humans + AIs for the next generation
  - Intelligence explosion that is a prologue to a grander future
  - Humanity on our journey to become a Type 1 civilization

**Scratchpad**
- AI is fundamentally about us being able to do more than what we can do
- [tinkerers](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-tinkerers), as human beings.
- Now we have something called artificial intelligence that is more capable than the things we had before. We see the future AI enhances our abilities, allows us to tinker and explore, collaborates with us, and lets us focus on what truly matters.
- [Tools made us human](https://news.emory.edu/features/2019/03/tiny-tools/index.html). Human cognitive abilities, along with tool augmentation from stone to modern technology have enabled us to continue our lineage. 
- As toolbuilders, we've created a variety of tools for different purposes. This capability to create specialized tools allowed us to transmit knowledge and skills across generations.
- AI that can tinker with an collaborate with us, like 
- We believe that humanity's strength lies in our ability to create and use tools that improve our lives. From the first stone tools to the smartphones in our pockets, we've always augmented our capabilities through tools.
- Like fire that cooked our food and forged our tools, or electricity that powered our cities and connected our world, AI sparks both wonder and worry. We believe that [AI augmenting human creativity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-024-09677-x) will help us change the future we've yet to imagine.
- AI has the potential to be the latest in humanity's long tradition of toolmaking, which has enabled us to

### Local AI

![Luke Skywalker & R2-D2](./_assets/Luke_Skywalker_R2-D2.jpg)
_We like that [Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker) can just open up [R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2) and tinker around._

- Local AI
  - R2D2 never called to GPT-4
  - Robots have intelligence
- How does this look?
  - Small models that can run locally on a phone, laptop or robot
  - Practical, useful models that can see, hear, do and talk
  - Deliver baseline level of thought quality
- Optional router to online models
  - Similar to how humans "google" (i.e. connect to the web)
  - Ask a friend (i.e. stronger model)

### Thought per Watt

- Computer Vision from GPUs to NPUs
- Highest quality thought per watt

### AI Alignment

Since the industrial revolution, technological progress has improved the human condition in every possible way. We don't perceive these positive trends due to our negativity bias, which evolved to make us extra attentive to negative information. 

History shows that new technologies bring both excitement and fear:

- Electricity sparked fear before it powered our world
- Space travel was impossible until we touched the stars
- AI stands as our next leap forward and offers both promise and challenges

**Points to make**
- Humanity has naturally been able to incorporate new technologies, while crafting clear standards, practices and regulation to mitigate risk and harm
- Electricity as an example: regulation, guidelines etc
- We stand for deep technical research into AI alignment with human values
- We stand for sensible, well-crafted regulation that prevents and punishes AI misuse
- We reject AI doomerism masquerading as AI safety
- We reject grifters and sensationalists who prey on AI safety
