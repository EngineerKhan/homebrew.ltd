## About

‚òï Coffee? No, we train AI.

Homebrew is an AI research lab. Our mission is to build human-augmenting AIs that run energy-efficiently on earth-friendly hardware.

<Callout>
We were inspired by the [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club), an early computer hobbyist group from 1975 to 1986 that led to Apple and the personal computer revolution.

## What drives us

When electricity first joined our homes, it was about igniting the human imagination besides banishing darkness. Most people feared it, however, those who saw its potential knew it would change every aspect of our lives. And it did.

At Homebrew, we see AI the same. Our focus is on AI, which pushes humanity forward by creating a world where technology doesn't just compute ‚Äì it elevates. We see future machines with AI and humans making us smarter, kinder, and more capable. It's about amplifying it - not replacing it.

- It's not about AI vs. humans
- It's about AI & humans - together, pushing the limits of what's possible

Like fire that cooked our food and forged our tools, or electricity that powered our cities and connected our world, AI sparks both wonder and worry. But we're convinced its light will reveal paths to change the future we've yet to imagine.

### Human Augmentation

_Early hearing aids were pivotal in augmenting human hearing._

We believe that humanity's strength lies in our ability to create and use tools that improve our lives. From the first stone tools to the smartphones in our pockets, we've always augmented our capabilities through tools.

- **Problem-solving & creativity**: AI that enhances our problem-solving abilities and expands our creative potential
- **Collaboration**: AI that collaborates with us to push the boundaries of innovation
- **Automating mundane tasks**: AI that frees us to focus on what truly matters, by automating mundane tasks

### Open Science

_The Open Science movement at CERN, birthplace of the World Wide Web._

We believe in open science. Our research findings, methodologies, and many of our tools are publicly available for scrutiny and further development by the wider AI community.

- **Open Source**: We share our code, and everyone can build upon and improve our work.
- **Build in Public**: We document our journey, successes, and failures
- **Right to Tinker**: We encourage our users to take it further by¬†tinkering[^1], extending, and customizing¬†our products to fit their needs.

### User Ownership & Privacy

AI can be very dangerous from the perspective that [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) accumulates way too much power, and privacy is sacrificed for utility. We believe AI can be advanced without sacrificing privacy.

- **User Ownership of Data**: Your data remains yours, always.
- **Local-first**: We adopt¬†[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)¬†principles and store data locally in¬†[universal file formats.](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
- **Self-hosted**: We provide options for users to run our AI on their own infrastructure.

We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg) [^2].

### Earth-friendly

Earth has been our home for billions of years. We owe future generations a habitable planet. We solve difficult problems at the hardware, software, and infrastructure levels to ensure that our work in AI does not harm the environment. We go beyond zero-carbon AI, to innovate on technologies like immersion cooling and energy-efficient chips, to make this happen.

- **Beyond Zero Carbon**: We aim for a net-positive environmental impact in our AI.
- **Energy Innovation**: We tend to collaborate with energy-efficient hardware to reduce AI's energy footprint.
- **Resource Optimization**: We focus on maximizing AI performance per watt.
