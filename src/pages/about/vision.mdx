# Principles

![First_Human_Flight](./_assets/First-human-flight.jpg)
_People once couldn't imagine flying, but the [Wright Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers) made it possible._

At Homebrew, our mission is to push the human race forward. 

We see a future where humanity can focus on what truly matters. Our vision is to build AI that makes us better – as thinkers, as [tinkerers](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-tinkerers), as human beings.

## Principles 

### Human Augmentation

_Spectacles improved human vision._

We believe that humanity's strength lies in our ability to create and use tools that improve our lives. From the first stone tools to the smartphones in our pockets, we've always augmented our capabilities through tools.

We have a chance to build AI to enhance our abilities on:

- **Problem-solving**: AI that enhances our abilities and expands our potential
- **Collaboration**: AI that we can tinker with and collaborate with us
- **Automating mundane tasks**: AI that frees us to focus on what truly matters by automating mundane tasks

### Open Science

_The Open Science movement at CERN, the birthplace of the World Wide Web._

We believe in [open science](https://www.cos.io/open-science). Our research findings, methodologies, and many of our tools are publicly available for scrutiny and further development by the wider AI community.

- **[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)**: We share our code, and everyone can build upon and improve our work
- **[Build-in Public](https://smallschool.is/build-in-public/what#:~:text=It%20means%20building%20a%20company,were%20making%20as%20trade%20secrets.)**: We document our journey, successes, and failures
- **Right to Tinker**: We encourage our users to take it further by tinkering, extending, and customizing our products to fit their needs 

### User Ownership & Privacy

AI can be very dangerous from the perspective that [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) accumulates way too much power, and privacy is sacrificed for utility. We believe AI can be advanced without sacrificing privacy.

- **User Ownership of Data**: Your data remains yours, always
- **Local-first**: We adopt [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) principles and store data locally in [universal file formats.](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
- **Self-hosted**: We provide options for users to run our AI on their own infrastructure

We make no attempt to lock you in, and our tools are free of [user-hostile dark patterns](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456?t=yGoUuKC9LsNGJxSAKv3Ubg)
