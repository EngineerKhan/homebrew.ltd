# Vision

![First_Human_Flight](./_assets/First-human-flight.jpg)
_People once couldn't imagine flying, but the [Wright Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers) made it possible._

At Homebrew, our mission is to push the human race forward. We see a future where humanity can focus on what truly matters. Our vision is to build AI that makes us better â€“ as thinkers, as [tinkerers](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-tinkerers), as human beings.

History shows that new technologies bring both excitement and fear:

- Electricity sparked fear before it powered our world
- Space travel was impossible until we saw the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth
- AI stands as our next leap forward and brings excitement and fear as well

In this AI leap, we should leverage AI, as toolmakers, to forge tools that will help our children solve the problems of tomorrow - problems we can't even imagine today.

## Human Augmentation

_We like that [Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker) can just open up [R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2) and tinker around._

[Tools made us human](https://news.emory.edu/features/2019/03/tiny-tools/index.html). Human cognitive abilities, along with tool augmentation from stone to modern technology have enabled us to continue our lineage. 

As toolbuilders, we've created a variety of tools for different purposes. This capability to create specialized tools allowed us to transmit knowledge and skills across generations.

Now we have something called artificial intelligence that is more capable than the things we had before. We see the future AI enhances our abilities, allows us to tinker and explore, collaborates with us, and lets us focus on what truly matters. We work on building this future.

At Homebrew, we're building AI that works alongside humans by enhancing our abilities, expanding our potential, and enabling us to overcome challenges we couldn't yet imagine today.
